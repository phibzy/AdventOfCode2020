# For this one, we're going to be using indices

# Each column index will map to a set of each valid field description
# Since we will have cases where we'll need deduction to work out
# valid field mappings, we want to find all valid fields for a column
# We'll pass through each ticket, removing possibilities for a field
# every time there's an invalid check

# For this to work though we first need to remove all invalid tickets

# We're then going to start with the sets with least elements, work 
# out their field, then remove said field from the other sets
# to narrow down possibilities. Rince and repeat until all sets
# have one element - a unique field.

# field is valid for only a single definition, yet
# it's the same one as another field with a single
# valid definition.

# My part 2 solution also assumes there is at least
# one column at the start which only has one possible
