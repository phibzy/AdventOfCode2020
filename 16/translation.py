# For this one, we're going to be using indices
# Start by making a dict of sets for each field index
# Each column index will map to a set of each valid field description
# Since we will have cases where we'll need deduction to work out
# valid field mappings, we want to find all valid fields for a column
# We'll pass through each ticket, removing possibilities for a field
# every time there's an invalid check

# For this to work though we first need to remove all invalid tickets

# We're then going to start with the sets with least elements, work 
# out their field, then remove said field from the other sets
# to narrow down possibilities. Rince and repeat until all sets
# have one element - a unique field.

# Think of it like a topological sort-like problem

# Although this may get the correct answers,

# E.g. the definition of a valid ticket is one
# where each field is valid for some field definition.
# But what this doesn't account for is if more than one
# field is valid for only a single definition, yet
# it's the same one as another field with a single
# valid definition.
